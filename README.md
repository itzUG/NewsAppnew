News App with the help of firebase
Here i created a news app with the help of firebase . Its not that great app to be consider but yet still have a lot of functions.
First its login page where you have to enter your login credentials or if you dont have one you can simply create by going to signup page. It also have forgot password option.
After signinig to the app user will recive a email verification code to confirm the device.
once after succesfully logging in youll be in the news feed page and the user can read any of the news after clicking one.
And i also implemented logout tag at the top-rightof the last page, after logging out user will be returned to the login scree.
